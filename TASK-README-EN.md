## Checking for plagiarism

The dual verification system includes: 

The organizers' own decision: We use algorithms to analyze your code, making sure that all the work is original.

Then the works of the Olympiad participants will be checked for illegal loans through the Codechecker service, a product of the Anti-Plagiat company.

Recommendations for using third-party code: if you decide to use code found in open sources, it is very important to specify the source of this code. This will make it easy to verify and confirm the authenticity of your work, as well as dispel any possible doubts. 

We urge all participants to adhere to the principles of academic integrity and to approach the competition openly and in good faith. The purpose of the Olympiad is not only to demonstrate your knowledge and skills, but also to develop as reliable and responsible specialists in the future.
